C++-Tests
=========

Some simple tests and examples, mostly for Boost libraries, GTest and the
C++-FitNesse fixture.

Some libraries are cloned as git submodules. To check out the repository and
all its submodules do the following:

    git clone https://github.com/hoelzl/CPlusPlus-Tests.git
    cd CPlusPlus-Tests
    git submodule init
    git submodule update --recursive
